It was across the weekend so there was no support, and it turned out the scale of the 2014 NIPS had broken a few different things. This caused me to start writing paper allocation code, within the space of a few days, without having much knowledge of the literature. This first piece of code simply allocates each paper to the top 40 high scoring reviewers. It is superceded by the code that follows. The code that follows ranks the entire matrix and starts by allocating to the highest score in the matrix. "
