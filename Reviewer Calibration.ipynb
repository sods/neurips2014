      "## Reviewer Calibration\n",
      "\n",
      "### 30th July 2014 Neil D. Lawrence\n",
      "\n",
      "In this note book we deal with reviewer calibration. Our assumption is that the score from the $j$th reviwer for the $i$th paper is given by\n",
      "$$\n",
      "y_{i,j} = f_i + b_j + \\epsilon_{i, j}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where $f_i$ is the 'objective quality' of paper $i$ and $b_j$ is an offset associated with reviewer $j$. $\\epsilon_{i,j}$ is a subjective quality estimate which reflects how a specific reviewer's opinion differs from other reviewers (such differences in opinion may be due to differing expertise or perspective). The underlying 'objective quality' of the paper  is assumed to be the same for all reviewers and the reviewer offset is assumed to be the same for all papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we have $n$ papers and $m$ reviewers then this implies $n$ + $m$ + $nm$ values need to be estimated. Naturally this is too many, and we can start by assuming that the subjective quality is drawn from a normal density with variance $\\sigma^2$\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\\epsilon_{i, j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})\n",
      "$$\n",
      "which reduces us to $n$ + $m$ + 1 parameters. Further we can assume that the objective quality is also normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\alpha_f$, \n",
      "$$\n",
      "f_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\alpha_f)\n",
      "$$\n",
      "this now reduces us to $m$+3 parameters. However, we only have approximately $4m$ observations (4 papers per reviewer) so parameters may still not be that well determined (particularly for those reviewers that have only one review). We therefore, finally, assume that reviewer offset is normally distributed with zero mean, \n",
      "$$\n",
      "b_j \\sim N(0, \\alpha_b),\n",
      "$$\n",

      "\\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\mu \\mathbf{1}, \\mathbf{K})\n",
      "$$\n",

      "$$\n",
      "where $i$ and $j$ are the index of first paper and reviewer and $k$ and $l$ are the index of second paper and reviewer.\n",
      "The mean is easily estimated by maximum likelihood, and is given as the mean of all scores. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is convenient to reparameterize slightly into an overall scale $\\alpha_f$, and normalized variance parameters,\n",
      "$$\n",

      "$$\n",
      "The advantage of this parameterization is it allows us to optimize $\\alpha_f$ directly (with a fixed point equation) and it will be very well determined. This leaves us with two free parameters, that we can explore on the grid. It is in these parameters that we expect the remaining underdetermindness of the model. We expect $\\alpha_f$ to be well determined because the negative log likelihood is now\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\\frac{|\\mathbf{y}|}{2}\\log\\alpha_f + \\frac{1}{2}\\log  \\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}\\right| + \\frac{1}{2\\alpha_f}\\mathbf{y}^\\top \\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where $|\\mathbf{y}|$ is the length of $\\mathbf{y}$ (i.e. the number of reviews) and $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}=\\alpha_f^{-1}\\mathbf{K}$ is the scale normalised covariance. This negative log likelihood is easily minimized to recover\n",
      "$$\n",

      "$$\n",
      "A Bayesian analysis of this parameter is possible with gamma priors, but it would merely shows that this parameter is extremely well determined (the degrees of freedom parameter of the associated Student-$t$ marginal likelihood scales will the number of reviews, which will be around $|\\mathbf{y}| \\approx 6,000$ in our case.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we propose to proceed as follows. Set the mean from the reviews ($\\mu$) and then choose a two dimensional grid of parameters for reviewer offset and diversity. For each parameter choice, optimize to find $\\alpha_f$ and then evaluate the liklihood. Worst case this will require us inverting $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}$, but if the reviewer paper groups are disconnected, it can be done a lot quicker. Next stage is to load in the reviews for analysis."
